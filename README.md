# Tours Project

## About

In this project I was practicing with using useState and useEffect.

To make it a bit cleaner i created a custom hook called useFetch. This allowed to fetch the data from the URL as well as have a little more functionality. This was to delete a single element, and to re-Fetch the data.
On top of that it returned different states that were used in the app.

To make it look more professional, conditional rendering was also implemented. Like showing a loading spinner or an error message.

The paragraphs utilize substring to make the complete info not be displayed. This also utilizes useState to keep a boolean value.
